                <p>I'm 18 years old and currently studying for a 3-year Bachelor of Technology in Networking and Telecommunications at the IUT in Colmar. In my second year, I'd like to do a work-study program, which would allow me to be independent, while working in a company would give me a foretaste of the world of work.</p>

                <p>I studied at the Saint-Jean institution in Colmar for 3 years. During these 3 years, I studied in the SN RISC stream. Specializing in computer networks, I acquired knowledge in this field that I was then able to improve or develop during the various internships I did.</p>

                <p>In second years, I did two internships in a small telephone and computer repair business called PC Phone located in Rouffach. This internship gave me a first idea of the world of work, which was a plus for me, but I won't be able to make a career out of it.</p>

                <p>In last years, I did two internships at the Don-Bosco institution in Wittenheim, where my tutor gave me the opportunity to work on a project. I had to install a digital signage server on my own. My tutor gave me various responsibilities, which helped me gain self-confidence.</p>

                <p>I would like to continue my studies in this field to progress so that I can hope to work as a network administrator. Or stop after the BUT and work as a network technician.</p>
